                    <br />
                    <p>Software Engineering has opened my eyes to a new world of creativity, problem solving and mystery I found too good to ignore. Executing scripts that Iâ€™ve written and seeing the work display and function how I intended is an extremely rewarding feeling. The idea that failing and breaking code is seen as a positive to refine your work and learn, aligns with my inner science values. What I find quite wholesome is the community of fellow developers, whether online or in a team, everyone works to better the other and share their thoughts, ideas and code!</p>
